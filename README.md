What are Semantic Search andÂ FAISS?

Semantic search and FAISS are related technologies used to search and retrieve information from large databases.
Semantic search is a type of search that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand the meaning of a search query and return relevant results. It goes beyond matching keywords and considers the context and relationships between words. This can make search results more accurate and relevant to the user's intent.

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a fast and efficient library for similarity search and metric learning. It can quickly find similar items in large datasets based on their similarities. It can be used in various applications, such as image and video search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing.

A practical application of semantic search with FAISS could be an e-commerce website. When a user searches for a product, semantic search can analyze the user's query and understand the meaning behind it. FAISS can then be used to quickly find similar products in the database based on their features and attributes, such as color, size, and brand. This can provide a more personalized and efficient shopping experience for the user.

In summary, semantic search is a way to search for information based on the meaning of a query, while FAISS is a library that helps to quickly find similar items in large datasets based on their similarities. Together, they can be used to improve search results and enhance the user experience in various applications, such as e-commerce websites.
